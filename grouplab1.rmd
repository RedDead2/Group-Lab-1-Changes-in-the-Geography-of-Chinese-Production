#Part 1.1
  Based off the â€œAll China Data Centerâ€ our assumption why some cities like Beijing and Shanghai are included in this list of provinces is due to population size. We noted many provinces with a population with 2,000,000 persons or more were considered â€œSuper Large-sized citiesâ€. 
  Looking in the database there is missing data on some provinces and cities which may be due to the fact that there just wasnâ€™t data collected in the region or data collected was incorrectly. Much of the data comes from the year 2000. On an atlas the part of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China that may people donâ€™t really focus on is Western China. People are more focused on the eastern parts of China. 
  
#Part 1.2
  It would be more reliable to use older data than current data because of how unreliable Chinaâ€™s information is. There was a lot of faking of data in the 90â€™. The data between 2000-2011 is considered the most accurate give or take. According to Bloomberg, â€œIf the official data lacks credibility, alternative narrativesâ€”like an economy on the verge of a hard landingâ€”can take hold,â€ says Tom Orlik. To validate this, Economist writes â€œAnd Chinaâ€™s national GDP figure is laughably out of line with the sum of its provincial GDP figures. The various levels of government cannot keep their statistical stories straight.â€ The article articulates on how China has data that doesnâ€™t correspond with other information discrediting the information. Since China has a difficult time concluding there true worth, it has gained a reputation to produce false information. Sara from Forbes writes, â€œBut after years of producing growth even in the darkest of circumstances, China has gained a reputation for possibly overestimating its growth rate.â€ This further recognizes how the more time goes by, the more unreliable Chinaâ€™s data actually is.

#Part 2.2 Visual 1
```{r PART2.2 Visual 1, include = TRUE}
###Create plot that is imported from the Year and Beijing_Enterprise columns
p <-ggplot(data = Data, aes(Year, Beijing_Enterprise))

###Imports third colum from the Tianjin_Enterprise column changing the bar to a different shade of blue 
p +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill =Tianjin_Enterprise))
```


#Part 2.2 Visual 2
```{r PART2.2 Visual 2, include = TRUE}
###Create plot that is imported from the Year and Ningxia_Enterprise columns

#Part 3.3
```{r library, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("mychinadatafor_lab1formarkdown.csv")
```

```{r ratio, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=data$Gansu_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main="Gansu Province")

#Made barplot for Gansu Province
```
  
  Within the Gansu Province, the monetary worth of enterprises in Gansu Province began to increase steadily in 1998 to 2000. This ratio then increased sharply up to 2017.





```{r beijing, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=data$Beijing_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main = "Beijing")

#Made barplot for Beijing
```


For Beijing, the monetary worth of Beijing's enterprises increased from 1998 to 2007. From 2010 to 2012, we can see a sharp increase in this ratio up to 2017. 


``` {r recode Shanghai, echo=FALSE}


#tw <- is.na(data$Shanghai_Output)

#data$Shanghai_Output[tw] <- 0

data$Year <- data$ï..Year
data$Year <- substring(data$Year,5)
data$Year <- as.numeric(data$Year)

shang_data <- data %>%
  select(Year, Shanghai_Output, Shanghai_Enterprise) %>%
  mutate(Shanghai_Output.Enterprise = Shanghai_Output/Shanghai_Enterprise)

#Recoding Shanghai data to omit the symbols in the "Year" column
```

```{r shanghai, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=shang_data$Shanghai_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main = "Shanghai")
        
#Made barplot for Shanghai        

```


From 1949 to 1991, the monetary worth of Shanghai's enterprises steadily grew. In 1995, this ratio grew sharply up to 2017.

#Part 3.5 
```{r PART3.5A, include = TRUE}
###Create plot that is imported from year and Hebei_Enterprise columns 
Test1 <-ggplot(data = Data, aes(Year, Hebei_Enterprise))

###Imports third column from the Shaanxi_Enterprise column changing the bar to a different shade of blue
Test1 +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill =Shaanxi_Enterprise))

#Columns Hebei_Enterprise and Shaanxi_Enterprise during the same years shows a correlation. The provinces show correlation in incline and decline during the same periods of time.
```

```{r PART3.5B, include = TRUE}
###Create plot that is imported from year and Shanghai_Enterprise columns 
Test2 <-ggplot(data = Data, aes(Year, Shanghai_Enterprise))

###Imports third column from the Liaoning_Enterprise column changing the bar to a different shade of blue
Test2 +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill =Liaoning_Enterprise))

#Columns Shanghai_Enterprise and Liaoning_Enterprise during the same years show a correlation later in the years. Earlier, there doesnt seem to be any correlation
```

```{r PART3.5C, include = TRUE}
###Create plot that is imported from year and Zhejiang_Enterprise columns 
Test3 <-ggplot(data = Data, aes(Year, Zhejiang_Enterprise))

###Imports third column from the Ningxia_Enterprise column changing the bar to a different shade of blue
Test3 +geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill =Ningxia_Enterprise))

#Columns Zhejiang_Enterprise and Ningxia_Enterprise during the same years show a correlation. The provinces show correlation in incline and decline during the same period of time.
