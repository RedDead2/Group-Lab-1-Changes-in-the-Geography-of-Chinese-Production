#Part 1.1
  Based off the â€œAll China Data Centerâ€ our assumption why some cities like Beijing and Shanghai are included in this list of provinces is due to population size. We noted many provinces with a population with 2,000,000 persons or more were considered â€œSuper Large-sized citiesâ€. 
  Looking in the database there is missing data on some provinces and cities which may be due to the fact that there just wasnâ€™t data collected in the region or data collected was incorrectly. Much of the data comes from the year 2000. On an atlas the part of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China that may people donâ€™t really focus on is Western China. People are more focused on the eastern parts of China. 
  
#Part 1.2
  It would be more reliable to use older data than current data because of how unreliable Chinaâ€™s information is. There was a lot of faking of data in the 90â€™. The data between 2000-2011 is considered the most accurate give or take. According to Bloomberg, â€œIf the official data lacks credibility, alternative narrativesâ€”like an economy on the verge of a hard landingâ€”can take hold,â€ says Tom Orlik. To validate this, Economist writes â€œAnd Chinaâ€™s national GDP figure is laughably out of line with the sum of its provincial GDP figures. The various levels of government cannot keep their statistical stories straight.â€ The article articulates on how China has data that doesnâ€™t correspond with other information discrediting the information. Since China has a difficult time concluding there true worth, it has gained a reputation to produce false information. Sara from Forbes writes, â€œBut after years of producing growth even in the darkest of circumstances, China has gained a reputation for possibly overestimating its growth rate.â€ This further recognizes how the more time goes by, the more unreliable Chinaâ€™s data actually is. 
  
### Specific years to look out for in our data

Because of the reasons listed above it is importent to talk about which years may not be as reliable as others in our data. There might be points that we have missed, but the following points are improtant to note while looking at our plots.

1. __1991-1994__: "Beijing fully adopted the international System of National Accounting (SNA) in 1995, which is designed to measure indicators of relevance to a market economy". Following this, it was revealed that that industrial data had serious problems with realiability. 

2. __1983-2011__: Statistical reforms are prevalent through this timeline meaning that definitions of output, output, GDP, etc. change. 

3. __1959-1962__: Called "The Great Leap Forward", China faced extreme declines in argiculure and local officials manipulated their data to reflect this more postively.

4. __1980's__: (already listed but for different reasons and slightly different range). China suffered large inflation and unemployment, but reported growth when some scholars believe it contracted in 1989.

5. __1998__: Asian Financial Crisis occurs. China still reports growth despite significant decline in certain industries (mostly energy consumption and airline travel). Also when the NBS revised historical data in 2005, 1998 was not given any revision.

### Summary
Here we have a comparison of the 8 economic regions of China. The most obious trend is that most of the enterprises and RMD output are on China's coast, which makes sense because China has a large manufacturing economy focused on shipping. Every region's RMD output is signifcantly reduced during the Asian Finanical Crisis in 1998. The build-up to it thought is very similar to the mortage crisis tha occured in the US though.

Output is lower in every graph, but enterprise goes up as well. possible they are the same enterprises. 

Shanghai and Beijing both start off the economic growth in the 1940's and the rest follow.

When it came to dealing with the NA values, I completely omitted them from the table.  This is because those cells simply have no data to compare with which can skew data if left in.

### Summary

Output of last 7 provinces in the legend decrease sharply after 2010 (most likely due to NA values). Growth increases in all regions until 2010.

#Part 3.3

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("mychinadatafor_lab1formarkdown.csv")
```

```{r ratio, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=data$Gansu_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main="Gansu Province")
#Made barplot for Gansu Province
```
  
  Within the Gansu Province, the monetary worth of enterprises in Gansu Province began to increase steadily in 1998 to 2000. This ratio then increased sharply up to 2017.





```{r beijing, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=data$Beijing_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main = "Beijing")
#Made barplot for Beijing
```


For Beijing, the monetary worth of Beijing's enterprises increased from 1998 to 2007. From 2010 to 2012, we can see a sharp increase in this ratio up to 2017. 


``` {r recode Shanghai, echo=FALSE}



#tw <- is.na(data$Shanghai_Output)
#data$Shanghai_Output[tw] <- 0
data$Year <- data$ï..Year
data$Year <- substring(data$Year,5)
data$Year <- as.numeric(data$Year)
shang_data <- data %>%
  select(Year, Shanghai_Output, Shanghai_Enterprise) %>%
  mutate(Shanghai_Output.Enterprise = Shanghai_Output/Shanghai_Enterprise)
#Recoding Shanghai data to omit the symbols in the "Year" column
```

```{r shanghai, echo=FALSE}
barplot(height=shang_data$Shanghai_Output.Enterprise, names.arg = seq(1949,2017), ylab="Output per Enterprise", xlab="Year", main = "Shanghai")
        
#Made barplot for Shanghai        
```


From 1949 to 1991, the monetary worth of Shanghai's enterprises steadily grew. In 1995, this ratio grew sharply up to 2017.
